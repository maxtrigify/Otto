/// otherwise. One-shot provider CLIs close their PTY just before their exit event arrives, so a
/// send_input that lands in that window fails with a closed transport even though nothing is
/// wrong: the agent simply finished. `agent.send_prompt` already recovers from that state — it
/// waits for the exit to settle and resumes or respawns the provider session — so the relay
/// falls through to it instead of reporting a transport failure to the person.
///
/// The fall-through is deliberately narrow. A closed transport is not proof of an exit: the PTY
/// write also reports it when a live TUI stops reading stdin for a second. So the relay only
/// continues once `agent.get_status` has actually reported a settled terminal state, and never
/// for an approval-shaped answer ("yes", "no", "go ahead") or an agent that was waiting for
/// permission — respawning a provider to run a whole turn on the prompt "yes" costs money and
/// leaves a baffling transcript. Those cases surface the short human error instead.
